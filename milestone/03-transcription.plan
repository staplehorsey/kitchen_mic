# Milestone 3: Audio Collection & Transcription

## Status: COMPLETED
Last Updated: 2024-12-08T16:31:57-05:00

## Overview
This milestone is split into two main components:
1. Conversation Collection: Combining VAD and audio into clean conversation objects
2. Transcription: Converting conversations to transcriptions

Each component is designed as a pure function that will later plug into the pipeline system.

## Part 1: Conversation Collection

### Goals
- [x] Create ConversationMessage data structure
- [x] Implement high-quality audio buffer
- [x] Build conversation collector
- [x] Add precise timing telemetry
- [x] Handle conversation boundaries

   - [x] Implemented 3-second pre-speech buffer
   - [x] Added precise timing telemetry
   - [x] Handle conversation boundaries

2. **Audio Processing Refinements**

### Components
1. **ConversationMessage**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ConversationMessage:
       id: str
       start_time: float
       end_time: float
       audio_data: np.ndarray  # 44kHz
