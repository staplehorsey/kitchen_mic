  - [ ] Create installation script
  - [ ] Handle environment setup
  - [ ] Configure audio devices
  - [ ] Set up storage directories
  - [ ] Auto-detect USB storage devices

- [ ] System Service Integration
  - [ ] Create systemd service unit
  - [ ] Implement orchestrator service wrapper
  - [ ] Configure auto-start behavior

  - [ ] Add service control commands (start/stop/restart)

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Write detailed setup guide
  - [ ] Document system requirements
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Create quick-start guide

## Implementation Plan

### Components

1. Configuration System (`src/config/`)
   - Main config file (`config.yaml`)
   - Storage configuration
     - Support for USB drive detection
     - Fallback paths
     - Storage quotas
   - Audio settings
     - Device selection
     - Sample rates
     - Buffer sizes
   - VAD parameters
     - Thresholds
     - Timing settings
   - Model configurations
     - Transcription model selection
     - LLM settings

2. Orchestrator Service (`src/service/`)
   - Service wrapper class
   - Config loading and validation
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Health monitoring
   - Status reporting

3. Installation Script (`install.sh`)
   - System dependency checks
   - Python environment setup
   - Directory structure creation
   - Permission configuration

### Technical Approach
1. Create idempotent installation process
2. Implement robust error handling
3. Add system health checks
4. Ensure proper cleanup on uninstall

## Success Criteria
- Clean installation on fresh system
- Reliable service operation
- Clear error messages
- Comprehensive documentation

## Progress Updates
