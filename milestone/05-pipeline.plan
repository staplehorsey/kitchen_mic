# Milestone 5: Background Processing ðŸ”„
Status: âœ… Completed
Last Updated: 2024-12-08T17:38:43-05:00

## Overview
Add background processing capability to handle completed conversations without blocking new audio capture.

## Goals
- [x] Process completed conversations in background
- [x] Maintain non-blocking audio capture
- [x] Coordinate components without tight coupling
- [x] Handle errors gracefully

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented background processing with the following components:

1. Conversation Orchestrator (`src/conversation/orchestrator.py`)
   - Coordinates between detector and processors
   - Manages background processing queue
   - Handles component lifecycle

2. Background Processing
   - Integrated existing components:
     - ConversationDetector
     - TranscriptionMessage/SummaryMessage
     - SummaryProcessor
   - Added queue for completed conversations
   - Processing in background thread

## Completed Phases

1. **Phase 1: Orchestrator** âœ…
   - [x] Created ConversationOrchestrator class
   - [x] Added conversation queue
   - [x] Set up background worker
   - [x] Added error handling

2. **Phase 2: Integration** âœ…
   - [x] Connected detector callback
   - [x] Processing through transcription
   - [x] Generating summaries
   - [x] Saving results

3. **Phase 3: Testing** âœ…
   - [x] Tested concurrent conversations
   - [x] Verified no blocking
   - [x] Checked error handling
   - [x] Validated results

## Technical Details

### Orchestrator Interface
```python
class ConversationOrchestrator:
    def start(self)  # Start processing
    def stop(self)   # Stop gracefully
    def get_status() # Check queue/processing state
```

### Error Handling
- Log errors without stopping
- Preserve failed conversations
- Report issues for debugging

## Success Criteria
1. New conversations can start while processing completes
2. No data loss on errors
3. Clean component coordination
4. Easy to monitor and debug

## Testing Strategy
1. Run multiple conversations in sequence
2. Verify processing completes correctly
3. Check error handling and recovery
4. Validate saved results

## Next Steps
See project.plan for installation and deployment steps.
