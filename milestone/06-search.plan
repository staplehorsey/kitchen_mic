Status: üí§ Not Started
Last Updated: 2024-12-08T17:41:59-05:00

## Overview
Implement search capabilities to find and retrieve past conversations based on topics, dates, and content. Focus on efficient indexing and retrieval of both transcripts and audio.

## Goals
- [ ] Build search index for conversations
  - [ ] Index transcripts for text search
  - [ ] Index topics and summaries
  - [ ] Index metadata (dates, durations)
- [ ] Implement search API
  - [ ] Text-based search
  - [ ] Topic-based filtering
  - [ ] Date range filtering
- [ ] Create efficient retrieval system
  - [ ] Fast transcript lookup
  - [ ] Quick audio segment access
  - [ ] Metadata retrieval

## Implementation Plan

### Components

1. Search Index (`src/search/index.py`)
   - Maintain searchable index of conversations
   - Handle incremental updates
   - Store metadata for quick filtering

2. Search API (`src/search/api.py`)
   - Query interface for conversations
   - Support multiple search criteria
   - Return relevant results with metadata

3. Retrieval System (`src/search/retrieval.py`)
   - Fast access to conversation content
   - Audio segment extraction
   - Transcript and summary fetching

### Technical Approach
1. Use vector embeddings for semantic search
2. Implement efficient date-based indexing
3. Create caching layer for frequent queries
4. Optimize audio segment extraction

## Success Criteria
- Sub-second search response times
- Accurate semantic matching
- Efficient storage usage
- Reliable audio segment retrieval

## Progress Updates
2024-12-08T17:41:59-05:00: Milestone file created
- Initial planning and component design
- Defined success criteria and technical approach
