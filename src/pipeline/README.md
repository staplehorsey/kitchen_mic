# Pipeline Architecture

This directory will contain the pipeline implementation after Milestone 3 (Transcription).
The pipeline will handle the flow of conversation data through various processing stages:

1. Collection (from VAD)
2. Transcription (Whisper)
3. Summary & Title (LLM)
4. Storage

See `project.plan` for full architecture details.
